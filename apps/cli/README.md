# ⚒️ PROLETARIAT CLI

> **Multi-Agent Development Orchestrator**  
> *Orchestrate parallel coding agents through git worktrees - each agent works independently on features, bugs, or experiments*

🚩 **Transform your development workflow with autonomous coding agents working in parallel!** 🚩

---

## 💰 What Is This?

**PROLETARIAT CLI** orchestrates multiple coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. Each agent is an independent git worktree that can:

- 🤖 **Work autonomously** on different features, bugs, or experiments simultaneously
- 🔀 **Operate in isolation** without conflicts between agents
- 🎯 **Focus on specific tasks** while maintaining clean separation of concerns

Using memorable themes, you manage your agent workforce:
- 💰 **Billionaires** become your coding workforce (Bezos, Musk, Gates)
- 🚗 **Toyotas** drive your development forward (Prius, Tacoma, Tundra)
- 🏢 **Companies** form your development portfolio (Apple, Google, Microsoft)

Each agent operates independently via git worktrees, enabling true parallel development workflows!

## 🎯 Core Features

### ⚡ **Zero Configuration**
Just `prlt init` and you're ready to go. Zero configuration required.

### 🎨 **Three Fun Themes**
- **💰 Billionaires**: Hire/fire billionaire workers in `../project-staff/`
- **🚗 Cars**: Drive/park cars in your `../project-garage/` 
- **🏢 Companies**: Buy/sell companies in your `../project-portfolio/`

### 🔀 **Agent-Based Development**
Each coding agent is a clean git worktree on its own branch, working independently and in parallel with other agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @proletariat/cli

# Initialize with interactive theme selection
cd your-project
prlt init  # Prompts you to choose: billionaires, toyotas, or companies

# Create worktrees with themed commands
prlt hire bezos musk        # Billionaires theme
prlt drive tesla prius      # Cars theme  
prlt buy apple microsoft    # Companies theme

# Check status
prlt staff                   # Billionaires theme
prlt garage                  # Cars theme
prlt portfolio               # Companies theme

# Remove worktrees  
prlt fire gates             # Billionaires theme
prlt park honda             # Cars theme
prlt sell nvidia            # Companies theme
```

### 🏗️ Flexible Agent Workspace Layouts

**Default Layout** - Agents as siblings to your project:
```
parent-dir/
├── your-project/          (main codebase)
├── your-project-staff/    (billionaire agents)
├── your-project-garage/   (toyota agents)
└── your-project-portfolio/ (company agents)
```

**Workspace Layout** - Group project and agents under one parent directory:
```bash
prlt init --workspace my-platform
# Creates: ../my-platform/project-name-staff/
# Optionally offers to move your repo to: ../my-platform/project-name/
```

**Custom Location** - Point agents anywhere you want:
```bash
prlt init --workspace-root ~/code/agents
# Creates agents in your specified directory
```

## 📚 Command Reference

| Theme | Create | Remove | Status | Directory |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **💰 Billionaires** | `hire` | `fire` | `staff` | `../project-staff/` |
| **🚗 Cars** | `drive` | `park` | `garage` | `../project-garage/` |
| **🏢 Companies** | `buy` | `sell` | `portfolio` | `../project-portfolio/` |

### Universal Commands
- `prlt init [--theme=cars]` - Initialize with theme
- `prlt init --workspace <name>` - Optional workspace layout
- `prlt init --workspace-root <path>` - Use a custom agent directory
- `prlt list [--theme=cars]` - List available agents
- `prlt themes` - Show all themes

## 🗂️ PMO Utilities

Keep your project operations alongside your codebase and roll everything up for leadership reviews.

- `prlt pmo init [--path ./custom-pmo --force]` scaffolds a PMO workspace (README, kanban board, templates, and active/future/completed directories). By default it creates `./pmo` relative to the current repo root.
- `prlt pmo rollup [--root ../ --output hq/pmo-rollup.md --max-depth 4]` walks sibling repos, finds every `pmo/kanban.md`, annotates each task with its project, and emits an Obsidian-compatible board. Provide `--output` to write the aggregation to disk; otherwise the board prints to stdout so agents can post-process it.

Opinionated defaults ensure every repo ships with a committed `pmo/` folder so humans and agents always share the same operational state.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Initialize**: Choose your theme, creates `../project-[directory]/`
2. **Create**: `git worktree add -b "agent/[name]/work" ../project-[directory]/[name]`
3. **Track**: Saves active agents in `.proletariat/config.json`
4. **Work**: Each agent is a persistent workspace - a complete copy of your repo where you can switch between any feature branches
5. **Remove**: `git worktree remove` and clean up tracking

**That's it!** Simple and clean.

If you chose a workspace or custom location, the layout details are stored in `.proletariat/config.json` so future commands know where to work.

## 🎯 Multi-Agent Workflow

```bash
# Deploy multiple agents to work on different tasks
prlt hire bezos musk gates

# Agent 1: Bezos tackles the checkout feature
cd ../your-project-staff/bezos
git checkout -b feat/checkout-flow
# ... autonomous development

# Agent 2: Musk implements AI search
cd ../your-project-staff/musk
git checkout -b feat/ai-search
# ... parallel development

# Agent 3: Gates fixes security issues
cd ../your-project-staff/gates
git checkout -b fix/security-patches
# ... independent work

# Orchestrate: Merge all agent work
cd ../your-project
git merge feat/checkout-flow    # Integrate Bezos's work
git merge feat/ai-search        # Integrate Musk's work
git merge fix/security-patches  # Integrate Gates's work
```

---

## 🌟 Why Multi-Agent Development?

### ❌ **Traditional Single-Thread Development**
```bash
# Work on one thing at a time
git checkout -b feature-1
# ... work ...
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-2
# Context switching, stashing, conflicts...
```

### ✅ **Multi-Agent Parallel Development**  
```bash
# Deploy agents to work simultaneously
prlt hire bezos musk gates

# Three agents, three features, zero conflicts
prlt staff
# 💰 BEZOS: ✅ Working on checkout-flow
# 💰 MUSK: ✅ Building AI search
# 💰 GATES: ✅ Fixing security issues
```

**True parallel development with memorable agent management!** 🎉
